# Raccoon HOA
You are elected the head of the HOA (through fraud) in suburban america. Your job is to inforce the completely fair rules of the Homeowners Association. You are doing that as a cover for your true calling, petty theft. Character waddles around on two feet in clothing. There will be NPC chatter where you can get info and also blackmail. You will talk like perry the platypus but people will be able to understand you for some reason. Chasing fleeing homeowners. Falling off porches while asserting autority. You get money, accept bribes. Eventually the NPCs will fight back through protest signs, passive-aggressive emails. NPCs argue, comply, resist, or plot. Things interfere (dogs, sprinklers, geese), police may show up, HOA board audits you. At the end of the day you will be able to spend money and shiny treasures on upgrades and new incresingly absurd rules. Sometimes special events such as BBQs with high risk high rewards.
